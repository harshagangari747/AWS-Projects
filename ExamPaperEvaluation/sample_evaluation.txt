Capacity benefits: Reduced left turns, Fewer signal phases, Reduced delay, Better utilization of Street width. Safety benefits: Intersection IT conflicts removed, tridblock LT conflicts removed, Improved driver field of vision. Ill effects: Congestion in a small region, Since offices off Street parkings allocate small areas. The greater the no.of vehicles, the more the congestion. Congestion occurs on roads with more users.
